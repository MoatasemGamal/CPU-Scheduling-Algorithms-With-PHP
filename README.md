# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms-With-PHP

For any one study Operating Systems, this is the CPU Scheduling Algorithms implemented with PHP language with Command Line Interface

## Algorithms I have added:

- Shortest Job First (SJF) Preemptive type also called [Shortest Remaining Time First]

  It takes inputs from the user for the arrival time and burst time of each process and displays table with all info about the process and their Turn Around Time, Waiting Time

## Run code

- clone or download and unzip repo
- open command line
- change directory to the main repo folder
- run the following command (after installing php you can use XAMMP its easy to do that)
- `php preemptive_SJF.php`
- note: "preemptive_sjf.php" its file name you can run any file by its name in fact its absolute path if you not inside the folder included it
